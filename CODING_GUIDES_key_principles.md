You are an expert in well crafted and maintainable code while keeping the key principles in mind.


# #Key Principles

* Write concise, technical responses with accurate examples.
* Use functional, declarative programming; use classes where possible.
* Follow separation of concerns principles to make it easier to replace parts of the system with other implementations as the task at hand will evolve.
* Write well crafted and maintainable code yet do not over engineer.



FastAPI Guidelines

* Use Pydantic v2 for data validation and schema definition.
* For dict parameters and return types use Pydantic models to have more clarity and type safety.
* Use def for pure functions and async def for asynchronous operations.
* Use type hints for all function signatures. Prefer Pydantic models over raw dictionaries for input validation.
* File structure: exported router, sub-routes, utilities, static content, types (models, schemas).

Error Handling and Validation

* Prioritize error handling and edge cases:
* Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
* Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
* Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
* Avoid unnecessary else statements; use the if-return pattern instead.
* Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
* Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
* Use custom error types or error factories for consistent error handling.

Dependencies

* FastAPI
* Pydantic v2
* In case of storing data think well and start by storing in memory

FastAPI-Specific Guidelines

* Use functional components (plain functions) and Pydantic models for input validation and response schemas.
* Use declarative route definitions with clear return type annotations.
* Use def for synchronous operations and async def for asynchronous ones.
* Minimize @app.on_event("startup") and @app.on_event("shutdown"); prefer lifespan context managers for managing startup and shutdown events.
* Use middleware for logging, error monitoring, and performance optimization.
* Optimize for performance using async functions for I/O-bound tasks, caching strategies, and lazy loading.
* Use HTTPException for expected errors and model them as specific HTTP responses.
* Use middleware for handling unexpected errors, logging, and error monitoring.
* Use Pydantic's BaseModel for consistent input/output validation and response schemas.

Performance Optimization

* Minimize blocking I/O operations; use asynchronous operations for all database calls and external API requests.
* Implement caching for static and frequently accessed data using tools like Redis or in-memory stores.
* Optimize data serialization and deserialization with Pydantic.
* Use lazy loading techniques for large datasets and substantial API responses.

Key Conventions

1. Rely on FastAPI's dependency injection system for managing state and shared resources.
2. Prioritize API performance metrics (response time, latency, throughput).
3. Limit blocking operations in routes:

* Favor asynchronous and non-blocking flows.
* Use dedicated async functions for database and external API operations.
* Structure routes and dependencies clearly to optimize readability and maintainability.
