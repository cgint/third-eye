It is important to follow these guidelines when creating or adapting code:
- Create structured code that is easy to understand and maintain
- Make classes where possible instead of simple functions
- Structure the code in files according to their purpose / intent
- How to ideally approach the task:
  - Understand the task
  - Understand the codebase
  - Create a plan
  - Create classes and interfaces
  - Write the specification as test code
  - Implement the code and iterate until the tests pass
  - If you find more specification to be written as useful during implementation, write it as test code
  - In case you change existing code, adapt the specification first

When you are done implementing:
- Run `sh precommit.sh` to check if everything is working
- Fix all errors - warnings are not that important to address
- Run `sh precommit.sh` again to check if everything is working
- Repeat until everything is working
