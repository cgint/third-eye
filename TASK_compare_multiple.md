# Info

I need an addon to the existing features of this project.

I want the user to be able to make evaluations of different products.
And then select evaluations in the history and ask for a comparison.
The selection should be a modal dialog where the user can select based on the image alone - i think that is the most usable way.

# Rough concept of the implementation

Pleae provide this rough architecture and which files need to be changed and also the actual changes you would make.

- Start with an introduction on what/why and a concept of the how
- Only return the code changes and not the full new files after the change.
