I need you to think thoroughly about the next task.

You will be given a python codebase that I have created and are asked to migrate it to a SvelteKit application.

In file TASK.md the original idea is described.

There are coding guidelines in CODING_GUIDES_key_principles.md and CODING_GUIDES_svelte_kit_with_be.md that i need you to adhere to.

In the directory working_samples/smart-ai.blog you will find a working example of a SvelteKit application that i have created.

You will need to create a new SvelteKit application and migrate the code from the python codebase to the SvelteKit application.

There are some specifics in the working_samples/smart-ai.blog that you will need to follow to make it run on Cloudflare Pages.
